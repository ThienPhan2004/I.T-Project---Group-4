        <h2>Caro</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Caro is a popular mind game, typically played on a squared paper grid.
          The objective is to arrange a continuous line of 5 pieces
          horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. The game can be played
          between two players, one using "X" and the other using "O".
        </p>
        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Two players take turns placing their pieces (X or O) on empty
            squares on the grid.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player who arranges 5 consecutive pieces horizontally,
            vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the board is full with no player having 5 consecutive pieces, the
            game ends in a draw.
          </li>
        </ul>
